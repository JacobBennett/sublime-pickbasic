# sublime-pick

A Sublime Text package that does syntax highlighting for PICK Basic

## What's Included

### Syntaxes

* PICK (Basic)

### Install

Using Custom Syntax Files in Sublime Text 3 

Mac OS:
To add custom syntax files using a Mac, open the following directory in Finder: Users/username/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/

Windows 10:
%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages
C:\Users\<Your User>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages

If you have git installed, you can just run:
git clone https://github.com/jordonbrill/sublime-pickbasic.git from inside the Packages directory listed above. If you install it from GitHub, when I update the syntax files in the future you will be able to update the files with a simple git pull command.

If you do not have git installed, you can navigate to my GitHub page linked to above and click Download Zip. That will download a zip file which can be extracted and placed into the Packages directory.

Once you have placed the folder into the Packages directory, quit Sublime Text 3 and reopen it. If you select View > Syntax you should see a Pick Basic option in your dropdown menu. Alternatively, you can invoke a keyboard command Command + Shift + P and they type “Pick Basic” and it will filter the options to allow you to set the syntax to Pick Basic.
